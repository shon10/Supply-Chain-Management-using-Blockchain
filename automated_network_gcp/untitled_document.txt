As the blockchain technology was gaining the hype, I started following various blogs and articles explaining the fuzz surrounding it. So I decided to gain an industry level experience in this field and to do an internship to gain the exposure. During my internship, I dived deep into various applications, consensus mechanisms, writing smart contracts for various applications. I built a fully automatic deployment system of private ethereum network on GCP which could deploy it within seconds. Created a smart contract to test the network for a use case of supply chain management of a car manufacturing company. Can't update the codes on GitHub because of NDA with the company.
